### The Judgement
> Decrease combined with sincerity  
> 
 Brings about supreme good fortune  
> 
 Without blame.  
> 
 One may be persevering in this.  
> 
 It furthers one to undertake something.  
> 
 How is this to be carried out?  
> 
 One may use two small bowls for the sacrifice.
### The Image
> At the foot of the mountain, the lake:  
> 
 The image of Decrease.  
> 
 Thus the superior man controls his anger  
> 
 And restrains his instincts.
### The Lines

> 
 Going quickly when one's tasks are finished  
> 
 Is without blame.  
> 
 But one must reflect on how much one may decrease others.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
> 
 Perseverance furthers.

 To undertake something brings misfortune.

 Without decreasing oneself,  
> 
 One is able to bring increase to others.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
> 
 When three people journey together,  
> 
 Their number decreases by one.

 When one man journeys alone,  
> 
 He finds a companion.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
> 
 If a man decreases his faults,  
> 
 It makes the other hasten to come and rejoice.  
> 
 No blame.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
> 
 Someone does indeed increase him.  
> 
 Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.  
> 
 Supreme good fortune.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
> 
 If one is increased without depriving others,  
> 
 there is no blame.  
> 
 Perseverance brings good fortune.  
> 
 It furthers one to undertake something.

 One obtains servants

 But no longer has a separate home.
