### The Judgement
> Modesty creates success.  
 The superior man carries things through.
### The Image
> Within the earth, a mountain:  
 The image of Modesty.  
 Thus the superior man reduces that which is too much,  
 And augments that which is too little.  
 He weighs things and makes them equal.

 To chastise one's own city and one's country.
