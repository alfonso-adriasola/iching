### The Judgement
> Duration. Success. No blame.  
 Perseverance furthers.  
 It furthers one to have somewhere to go.
### The Image
> Thunder and wind: the image of Duration.  
 Thus the superior man stands firm  
 And does not change his direction.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 Seeking duration too hastily brings misfortune persistently.  
 Nothing that would further.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 Remorse disappears.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 He who does not give duration to his character  
 Meets with disgrace.  
 Persistent humiliation.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 No game in the field.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Giving duration to one's character through perseverance.  
 This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 Restlessness as an enduring condition brings misfortune.
