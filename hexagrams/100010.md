### The Judgement
> Youthful Folly has success.  
 It is not I who seek the young fool;  
 The young fool seeks me.  
 At the first oracle I inform him.  
 If he asks two or three times, it is importunity.  
 If he importunes, I give him no information.  
 Perseverance furthers.
### The Image
> A spring wells up at the foot of the mountain:  
 The image of Youth.  
 Thus the superior man fosters his character  
 By thoroughness in all that he does.
### The Lines

#### Change at the beginning means:**  
 To make a fool develop  
 It furthers one to apply discipline.  
 The fetters should be removed.  
 To go on in this way brings humiliation.
#### Change in the second place means:**  
 To bear with fools in kindliness brings good fortune.  
 To know how to take women  
 Brings good fortune.  
 The son is capable of taking charge of the household.
#### Change in the third place means:**  
 Take not a maiden who, when she sees a man of bronze,  
 Loses possession of herself.  
 Nothing furthers.
#### Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Entangled folly brings humiliation.
#### Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Childlike folly brings good fortune.
#### Change at the top means:**  
 In punishing folly  
 It does not further one  
 To commit transgressions.  
 The only thing that furthers  
 Is to prevent transgressions.
