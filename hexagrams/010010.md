### The Judgement
> The Abysmal repeated.  
 If you are sincere, you have success in your heart,  
 And whatever you do succeeds.
### The Image
> Water flows on uninterruptedly and reaches it goal:  
 The image of the Abysmal repeated.  
 Thus the superior man walks in lasting virtue  
 And carries on the business of teaching.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 Repetition of the Abysmal.  
 In the abyss one falls into a pit.  
 Misfortune.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 The abyss is dangerous.  
 One should strive to attain small things only.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 Forward and backward, abyss on abyss.  
 In danger like this, pause at first and wait,  
 Otherwise you will fall into a pit in the abyss.  
 Do not act in this way.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 A jug of wine, a bowl of rice with it;  
 Earthen vessels  
 Simply handed in through the window.  
 There is certainly no blame in this.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 The abyss is not filled to overflowing,  
 It is filled only to the rim.  
 No blame.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 Bound with cords and ropes,  
 Shut in between thorn-hedged prison walls:  
 For three years one does not find the way.  
 Misfortune.
