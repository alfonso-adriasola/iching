### The Judgement
> Conflict. You are sincere  
 And are being obstructed.  
 A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.  
 Going through to the end brings misfortune.  
 It furthers one to see the great man.  
 It does not further one to cross the great water.
### The Image
> Heaven and water go their opposite ways:  
 The image of Conflict.  
 Thus in all his transactions the superior man  
 Carefully considers the beginning.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 If one does not perpetuate the affair,  
 There is little gossip.  
 In the end, good fortune comes.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 One cannot engage in conflict;  
 One returns home, gives way.  
 The people of his town,  
 Three hundred households,  
 Remain free of guilt.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 To nourish oneself on ancient virtue induces perseverance.  
 Danger. In the end, good fortune comes.  
 If by chance you are in the service of a king,  
 Seek not works.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 One cannot engage in conflict.  
 One turns back and submits to fate,  
 Changes one's attitude,  
 And finds peace in perseverance.  
 Good fortune.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 To contend before him  
 Brings good fortune.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 Even if by chance a leather belt is bestowed on one,  
 By the end of morning  
 It will have been snatched away three times.
