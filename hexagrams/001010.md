### The Judgement
> Deliverance. The southwest furthers.  
 If there is no longer anything where one has to go,  
 Return brings good fortune.  
 If there is still something where one has to go,  
 Hastening brings good fortune.
### The Image
> Thunder and rain set in:  
 The image of Deliverance.  
 Thus the superior man pardons mistakes  
 And forgives misdeeds.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 Without blame.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 One kills three foxes in the field  
 And receives a yellow arrow.  
 Perseverance brings good fortune.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 If a man carries a burden on his back  
 And nontheless rides in a carriage,  
 He thereby encourages robbers to draw near.  
 Perseverance leads to humiliation.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Deliver yourself from your great toe.  
 Then the companion comes,  
 And him you can trust.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 If only the superior man can deliver himself,  
 It brings good fortune.  
 Thus he proves to inferior men that he is in earnest.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 The prince shoots at a hawk on a high wall.  
 He kills it. Everything serves to further.
