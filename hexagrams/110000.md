### The Judgement
> Contemplation. The ablution has been made,  
 But not yet the offering.  
 Full of trust they look up to him.
### The Image
> The wind blows over the earth:  
 The image of Contemplation.  
 Thus the kings of old visited the regions of the world,  
 Contemplated the people,  
 And gave them instruction.
### The Lines

#### Change at the beginning means:**  
 Boylike contemplation.  
 For an inferior man, no blame.  
 For a superior man, humiliation.
#### Change in the second place means:**  
 Contemplation through the crack of the door.  
 Furthering for the perseverance of a woman.
#### Change in the third place means:**  
 Contemplation of my life  
 Decides the choice  
 Between advance and retreat.
#### Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Contemplation of the light of the kingdom.  
 It furthers one to exert influence as the guest of a king.
#### Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Contemplation of my life.  
 The superior man is without blame.
#### Change at the top means:**  
 Contemplation of his life.  
 The superior man is without blame.
