### The Judgement
> Keeping Still. Keeping his back still  
 So that he no longer feels his body.  
 He goes into the courtyard  
 And does not see his people.  
 No blame.
### The Image
> Mountains standing close together:  
 The image of Keeping Still.  
 Thus the superior man  
 Does not permit his thoughts  
 To go beyond his situation.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 Keeping his toes still.  
 No blame.  
 Continued perseverance furthers.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 Keeping his calves still.  
 He cannot rescue him whom he follows.  
 His heart is not glad.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 Keeping his hips still.  
 Making his sacrum stiff.  
 Dangerous. The heart suffocates.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Keeping his trunk still.  
 No blame.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Keeping his jaws still.  
 The words have order.  
 Remorse disappears.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 Noblehearted keeping still.  
 Good fortune.
