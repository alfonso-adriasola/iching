 Success.

 The image of The Caldron.  
 Thus the superior man consolidates his fate  
 By making his position correct.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 A _ting_ with legs upturned.  
 Furthers removal of stagnating stuff.  
 One takes a concubine for the sake of her son.  
 No blame.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 There is food in the _ting_.  
 My comrades are envious,  
 But they cannot harm me.  
 Good fortune.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 The handle of the _ting_ is altered.  
 One is impeded in his way of life.  
 The fat of the pheasant is not eaten.  
 Once rain falls, remorse is spent.  
 Good fortune comes in the end.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 The legs of the _ting_ are broken.  
 The prince's meal is spilled  
 And his person is soiled.  
 Misfortune.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 The _ting_ has yellow handles, golden carrying rings.  
 Perseverance furthers.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 The _ting_ has rings of jade.  
 Great good fortune.  
 Nothing that would not act to further.
