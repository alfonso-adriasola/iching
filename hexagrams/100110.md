### The Judgement
> Work on What Has Been Spoiled  
 Has supreme success.  
 It furthers one to cross the great water.  
 Before the starting point, three days.  
 After the starting point, three days.
### The Image
> The wind blows low on the mountain:  
 The image of Decay.  
 Thus the superior man stirs up the people  
 And strengthens their spirit.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.  
 If there is a son,  
 No blame rests upon the departed father.  
 Danger. In the end good fortune.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 Setting right what has been spoiled by the mother.  
 One must not be too persevering.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.  
 There will be little remorse. No great blame.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Tolerating what has been spoiled by the father.  
 In continuing one sees humiliation.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.  
 One meets with praise.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 He does not serve kings and princes,  
 Sets himself higher goals.
