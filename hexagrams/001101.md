### The Judgement
> Abundance has success.  
 The king attains abundance.  
 Be not sad.  
 Be like the sun at midday.
### The Image
> Both thunder and lightning come:  
 The image of Abundance.  
 Thus the superior man decides lawsuits  
 And carries out punishments.
### The Lines

#### Change at the beginning means:**  
 When a man meets his destined ruler,  
 They can be together ten days,  
 And it is not a mistake.  
 Going meets with recognition.
#### Change in the second place means:**  
 The curtain is of such fullness  
 That the polestars can be seen at noon.  
 Through going one meets with mistrust and hate.  
 If one rouses him through truth,  
 Good fortune comes.
#### Change in the third place means:**  
 The underbrush is of such abundance  
 That the small stars can be seen at noon.  
 He breaks his right arm. No blame.
#### Change in the fourth place means:**  
 The curtain is of such fullness  
 That the polestars can be seen at noon.  
 He meets his ruler, who is of like kind.  
 Good fortune.
#### Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Lines are coming,  
 Blessing and fame draw near.  
 Good fortune.
#### Change at the top means:**  
 His house is in a state of abundance.  
 He screens off his family.  
 He peers through the gate  
 And no longer perceives anyone.  
 For three years he sees nothing.  
 Misfortune.
