### The Judgement
> Grace has success.  
 In small matters  
 It is favorable to undertake something.
### The Image
> Fire at the foot of the mountain:  
 The image of Grace.  
 Thus does the superior man proceed  
 When clearing up current affairs.  
 But he dare not decide controversial issues in this way.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 He lends grace to his toes, leaves the carriage, and walks.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 Lends grace to the beard on his chin.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 Graceful and moist.  
 Constant perseverance brings good fortune.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Grace or simplicity?  
 A white horse comes as if on wings.  
 He is not a robber,  
 He will woo at the right time.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Grace in the hills and gardens.  
 The roll of silk is meager and small.  
 Humiliation, but in the end good fortune.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 Simple grace. No blame.
