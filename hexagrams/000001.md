### The Judgement
> Return. Success.  
 Going out and coming in without error.  
 Friends come without blame.  
 To and Fro goes the way.  
 On the seventh day comes return.  
 It furthers one to have somewhere to go.
### The Image
> Thunder within the earth:  
 The image of The Turning Point.  
 Thus the kings of antiquity closed the passes  
 At the time of solstice.  
 Merchants and strangers did not go about,  
 And the ruler  
 Did not travel through the provinces.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 Return from a short distance.  
 No need for remorse.  
 Great good fortune.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 Quiet return. Good fortune.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 Repeated return. Danger. No blame.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Walking in the midst of others,  
 One returns alone.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Noblehearted return.  
 No remorse.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 Missing the return. Misfortune.  
 Misfortune from within and without.  
 If armies are set marching in this way,  
 One will in the end suffer a great defeat,  
 Disastrous for the ruler of the country.  
 For ten years  
 It will not be possible to attack again.
