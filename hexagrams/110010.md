### The Judgement
> Dispersion. Success.  
 The king approaches his temple.  
 It furthers one to cross the great water.  
 Perseverance furthers.
### The Image
> The wind drives over the water:  
 The image of Dispersion.  
 Thus the kings of old sacrificed to the Lord  
 And built temples.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 He brings help with the strength of a horse.  
 Good fortune.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 At the dissolution  
 He hurries to that which supports him.  
 Remorse disappears.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 He dissolves his self. No remorse.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 He dissolves his bond with his group.  
 Supreme good fortune.  
 Dispersion leads in turn to accumulation.  
 This is something that ordinary men do not think of.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 His loud cries are as dissolving as sweat.  
 Dissolution! A king abides without blame.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 He dissolves his blood.  
 Departing, keeping at a distance, going out,  
 Is without blame.
