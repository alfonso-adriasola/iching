### The Judgement

 The image of The Family.  
 Thus the superior man has substance in his words  
 And duration in his way of life.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 Firm seclusion within the family.  
 Remorse disappears.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 She should not follow her whims.  
 She must attend within to the food.  
 Perseverance brings good fortune.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 When tempers flare up in the family,  
 Too great severity brings remorse.  
 Good fortune nonetheless.  
 When woman and child dally and laugh,  
 It leads in the end to humiliation.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 She is the treasure of the house.  
 Great good fortune.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 As a king he approaches his family.  
 Fear not.  
 Good fortune.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 His work commands respect.  
 In the end good fortune comes.
