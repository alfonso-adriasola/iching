### The Judgement
> The Clinging. Perseverance furthers.  
 It brings success.  
 Care of the cow brings good fortune.
### The Image
> That which is bright rises twice:  
 The image of Fire.  
 Thus the great man, by perpetuating this brightness,  
 Illumines the four quarters of the world.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 The footprints run crisscross.  
 If one is seriously intent, no blame.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 Yellow light. Supreme good fortune.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 In the light of the setting sun,  
 Men either beat the pot and sing  
 Or loudly bewail the approach of old age.  
 Misfortune.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Its coming is sudden;  
 It flames up, dies down, is thrown away.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Tears in floods, sighing and lamenting.  
 Good fortune.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 The king uses him to march forth and chastise.  
 Then it is best to kill the leaders  
 And take captive the followers. No blame.
