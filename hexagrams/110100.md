### The Judgement
> Development. The maiden  
 Is given in marriage.  
 Good fortune.  
 Perseverance furthers.
### The Image

 The image of Development.  
 Thus the superior man abides in dignity and virtue,  
 In order to improve the mores.

 The wild goose gradually draws near the shore.  
 The young son is in danger.  
 There is talk. No blame.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 The wild goose gradually draws near the cliff.  
 Eating and drinking in peace and concord.  
 Good fortune.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 The wild goose gradually draws near the plateau.  
 The man goes forth and does not return.  
 The woman carries a child but does not bring it forth.  
 Misfortune.  
 It furthers one to fight off robbers.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 The wild goose gradually draws near the tree.  
 Perhaps it will find a flat branch. No blame.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**

 For three years the woman has no child.  
 In the end nothing can hinder her.

 Its feathers can be used for the sacred dance.  
 Good fortune.
