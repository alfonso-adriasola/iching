      █████████ below _Tui_ The Joyous, Lake

### The Judgement
> The Marrying Maiden.  
 Undertakings bring misfortune.  
 Nothing that would further.
### The Image
> Thunder over the lake:  
 The image of The Marrying Maiden.  
 Thus the superior man  
 Understands the transitory  
 In the light of the eternity of the end.
### The Lines

#### Change at the beginning means:**  
 The marrying maiden as a concubine.  
 A lame man who is able to tread.  
 Undertakings bring good fortune.
#### Change in the second place means:**  
 A one-eyed man who is able to see.  
 The perseverance of a solitary man furthers.
#### Change in the third place means:**  
 The marrying maiden as a slave.  
 She marries as a concubine.
#### Change in the fourth place means:**  
 The marrying maiden draws out the allotted time.  
 A late marriage comes in due course.
#### Change in the fifth place means:**  
 The sovereign I gave his daughter in marriage.  
 The embroidered garments of the princess  
 Were not as gorgeous  
 As those of the servingmaid.  
 The moon that is nearly full  
 Brings good fortune.
#### Change at the top means:**  
 The woman holds the basket, but there are no fruits in it.  
 The man stabs the sheep, but no blood flows.  
 Nothing that acts to further.
