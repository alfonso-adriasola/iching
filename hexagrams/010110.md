### The Judgement
> The Well. The town may be changed,  
 But the well cannot be changed.  
 It neither decreases nor increases.  
 They come and go and draw from the well.  
 If one gets down almost to the water  
 And the rope does not go all the way,  
 Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.
### The Image
> Water over wood: the image of The Well.  
 Thus the superior man encourages the people at their work,  
 And exhorts them to help one another.
### The Lines

#### Change at the beginning means:**  
 One does not drink the mud of the well.  
 No animals come to an old well.
#### Change in the second place means:**  
 At the well hole one shoots fishes.  
 The jug is broken and leaks.
#### Change in the third place means:**  
 The well is cleaned, but no one drinks from it.  
 This is my heart's sorrow,  
 For one might draw from it.  
 If the king were clear-minded,  
 Good fortune might be enjoyed in common.
#### Change in the fourth place means:**  
 The well is being lined. No blame.
#### Change in the fifth place means:**  
 In the well there is a clear, cold spring  
 From which one can drink.
#### Change at the top means:**  
 One draws from the well  
 Without hindrance.  
 It is dependable.  
 Supreme good fortune.
