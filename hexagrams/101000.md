### The Judgement
> Progress. The powerful prince  
 Is honored with horses in large numbers.  
 In a single day he is granted audience three times.
### The Image
> The sun rises over the earth:  
 The image of Progress.  
 Thus the superior man himself  
 Brightens his bright virtue
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 Progressing, but turning back.  
 Perseverance brings good fortune.  
 If one meets with no confidence, one should remain calm.  
 No mistake.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 Progressing, but in sorrow.  
 Perseverance brings good fortune.  
 Then one obtains happiness from one's ancestress.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 All are in accord. Remorse disappears.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Progress like a hamster.  
 Perseverance brings danger.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Remorse disappears.  
 Take not gain and loss to heart.  
 Undertakings bring good fortune.  
 Everything serves to further.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 Making progress with the horns is permissible  
 Only for the purpose of punishing one's own city.  
 To be conscious of danger brings good fortune.  
 No blame.  
 Perseverance brings humiliation.
